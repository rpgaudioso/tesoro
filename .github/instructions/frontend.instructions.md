# Frontend Instructions

## Data fetching

- Always implement: loading, empty, and error states.

## UI

- Prefer Design System components and CSS Modules; avoid inline styles unless necessary.
- Keep components small and reusable (component-driven approach).

## Forms

- Use the repo's preferred form approach.
- Keep validation errors visible and accessible.

## Performance / UX

- Avoid unnecessary re-renders; memoize heavy computations when needed.
- Don’t introduce new UI libraries without asking.
